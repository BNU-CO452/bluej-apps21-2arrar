 1980, Russia. The war between the Soviet's and the Rural's a 
 is at its peak. 
 The local general has requested those able to enlist, so you did. 
 
 After a couple weeks, you received training as a Soviet Pilot 
 and are stationed near the region of conflict. 
 It was the day of your mission. You tighten the straps of your 
 leather helmet and positioned yourself in the Mi-24 helicopter. 
 Signal given, you ascend into the skies and brave the airspace4 
 alone. 
 
 You admired the beautiful mountain range this area has to offer 
 as you do, you begin to veer off your given flight path. 
  
 *$%£$$!!^£&*£%^£* 
 A blast would take out your rear properller, you are under attack 
 The helicopter begins to swing out of control. 
 Descending at rapid speeds, you panic, shut your eyes- and brace for impact.

Scenario
--------------------
 You awake to find yourself laying in a desert. 
 You are surrounded by metal debris. 
 The hot sun stares as you try to recollect your conscience 
 
 Your uniform is torn, survival gear torched. 
 Around you is your battle rifle and a map. 
 You must find some sort of flare to signal a rescue 
 Good luck SENTRY
